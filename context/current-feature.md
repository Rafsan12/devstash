# Current Feature: Toggle Email Verification

## Status

Complete

## Goals

- Add a single toggle that enables or disables the email verification requirement.
- When disabled, let new users register and sign in without receiving a verification email.
- Keep verification-specific routes and messaging aligned with the toggle state.
- Document the toggle in the example environment configuration.

## Notes

- Use an environment variable so local development can disable the verification flow until a Resend domain is available.
- Keep the enabled path working as-is when the toggle is turned on.
